# surfs_up
Software: SQLite, Flask and Jupyter Notebook

 1. In December the temperature can reach upto 4.94, which is 4 times the max the weather can reach in June which is 0.89
 2. The data is tightly spread along the standard deviation in June. The SD is 0.089
 3. The standard deviation is more for December which is 0.43
 4. The mean for June is 0.02 which is very less than mean for December which is 0.11
   
   Hence it is better to surf in June than in December as there is less precipitation.
   Also, we need to check the wind speed to check if surfers will show up to make our predictions are accurate.
